Created an app that collects and display moisture data from censors being pulled behind a tractor in real time. The data is displayed in graphs, meters, and uses a map to display **GeoJSON** data. It uses **React**, **Redux**, and **Capacitor** for the front end and operates on data sent through an **MQTT** protocol provided by hardware on the tractor.

I absolutely loved this project!
